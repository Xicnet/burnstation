#!/bin/bash
#
# this script will convert ONLY the listed directories and set the LABEL tag to every file
#

# this is the path to the new un-tagged labels root dir 
musicPath="/usr/local/media"

#
# NOTE 1: do not execute this script more than one time over the same file otherwise
#         the files will have the tag more than once and it can be a problem
#
# NOTE 2: it takes a while per each directory, so just let it work without interrupting it
#
# NOTE 3: the following are just two examples, modify as appropriate to adapt to your case
#

cd $musicPath/some_label_name_here && find -type f -iname "*.ogg" -exec vorbiscomment -a -t "LABEL=The Label Name" \{\} \; && echo "[*] seems the label was tagged correctly!"
