    # The getRecursiveDirList() method accepts a directory path as an argument and
    # then recursively searches through that path looking for directories to return
    # to you in the form of a list.

    # are only passing one argument (a directory path) to this method.  However, 
    # when we declare the method here, we are specifying two arguments.
    #
    # This is, in my opinion, an oddity with Python classes.  If this
    # method were a stand-alone function outside of a class, then you would not need the
    # "self" argument.  The reasons for this oddity are beyond the scope of this tutorial so
    # just take in on faith for now that whenever you create a method inside of a class,
    # its first argument must be "self", followed by any other arguments you wish to add.

        #
        # Since things can go wrong, like a user mistakenly entering their first name instead of a valid
        # directory, we need to place this code within a try: except: statement.  If we didn't do this,
        # and a user entered invalid data, our program would crash.  By placing error handling
        # around our code like this, we are able to print out a friendly, trust-inspiring message
        # to the user instead of a bleak stack trace.  In this case, I'm only catching a "WindowsError",
        # which is sort of robust, but not really.

        # exception as an example of catching a specific type of error.
        #
        # Using specific exception types in your error handling allows you to customize
        # error messages for each type of error that occurs instead of always printing

    # The getRecursiveFileList() method accepts a directory path as an argument and
    # then recursively searches through that path looking for files to return
    # to you in the form of a list.
    #
    # Notice that this method also has "self" as its first argument.  This is because
    # it is also part of a class.  If it were a stand-alone function, we wouldn't need
    # this argument.  In fact, our program would probably crash if we had it there in
    # that case.
    #
    # You probably noticed that getRecursiveFileList has one more parameter than
    # getRecursiveDirList has (extensions=[]).  This allows us to limit the list of
    # files to a certain extension, or list of extensions.  For example, if I
    # called this method like this:
    #       getRecursiveFileList('/home/user/documents', ['html', 'htm', 'txt'])
    # then the method would only return files to me that had those three extensions.
    #
    # On the other hand, I don't want to have to type ALL possible extensions when
    # I want absolutely everything, so I declare the extensions variable like this:
    #        extensions=[]
    # This means that "extensions" is optional.  The method will take whatever
    # extensions I give it, but if I choose to leave them off, it will default
    # to an empty list, which my code interprets to mean "everything".
    #
    # You can make any parameter optional by appending an equals sign to it and
    # following that with a default value (e.g. printName(fname="unknown", lname="unknown")).
    #
    # IMPORTANT NOTE: Python orders the variables you pass to a method by applying the
    # first variable to the first item in the method's parameter list, second to second,
    # and so forth.  So, if you had this method:
    #        printName(fname="unknown", lname="unknown")
    # and you were trying to print a name, but you only knew the last name, Smith, you
    # couldn't just type "printName("Smith") because Python would assign the last name
    # Smith to the fname (first name) variable; which isn't what you want.
    #
    # In this case, to get the variables to align correctly, you would have to either type
    # "printName("unknown", "Smith"), which doesn't take advantage of your optional parameters,
    # or better yet, type "printName(lname="Smith)".  This will assign smith to the lname variable
    # and let the fname variable revert to its default value automatically.
