IMPORTING MUSIC INTO THE 'burnstation' DATABASE
===============================================

1) Be sure to have your OGG files properly tagged.
   Required tags are: 'title' and 'artist'.
   If possible, you should also include a 'license' tag
   where you state under which license each track is published.

2) Put all your OGG files and directories inside a base directory
   with the name of your net-label. If you are not publishing within
   any label, just call the directory with your artist name.
   Try to avoid spaces and special characters for the dir name.

3) Copy your base directory into your burnstation music repository,
   typically /usr/local/media/music

4) Change to directory pygameGUI/publish
   and execute: burnstation-publisher.py PATH_TO_YOUR_BASEDIR LABEL_NAME
   Example: burnstation-publisher.py /usr/local/media/music/Costellam Costellam

5) Done! Run burnstation and enjoy!
