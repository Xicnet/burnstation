I. Base system installation and configuration
---------------------------------------------

1) download the Debian CD image (http://cdimage.debian.org/pub/weekly/i386/)
2) install the OS
3) secure your system
	
4) configure soundcard and CD-R
. make sure permissions for all users are granted to read/write sound & mixer device.
. it should look like this:

# ls -l /dev/dsp0
crw-rw-rw-  1 root audio 14, 3 2004-03-27 20:01 /dev/dsp0

# ls -l /dev/mixer0
crw-rw-rw-  1 root audio 14, 0 2004-03-27 20:01 /dev/mixer0
	
if it the last "rw-" flags are set to something different like "---"
you should do:

	chmod 666 /dev/dsp0
	chmod 666 /dev/mixer0

5) if you have not done so, re-configure cdrecord to run in SUID mode
(this will let non-root users use the CD burner)

6) configure joystick and load modules forever:
. modconf (in joystick module add (+) adi for logitech rumblepad for example)
	
7) create a user for the BurnStation
. issue the following command:
	
# useradd burn -G cdrom,audio
  (this creates the "burn" user and adds him to
  the "cdrom" and "sound" groups)

# passwd
  (will prompt for a password)
	
8) configure /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf to have the box autologin
as the burn user (without password) as default:

AutomaticLoginEnable=true  		    	    
AutomaticLogin=burn

9) create the spool directory, where temporary files will reside at burn time:
NOTE: they will be deleted when burn is finished

# mkdir /var/spool/burnstation

9.b) set the proper permissions to the spool directory

# chown burn.root /var/spool/burnstation
# chmod 755 /var/spool/burnstation

10) copy the bin/burnstation script to your /usr/local/bin to make it wide-system run-able:

# cp bin/burnstation /usr/local/bin/

II. Install additional required dependencies
--------------------------------------------

* General packages

smbclient - a LanManager-like simple client for Unix
xmms - Versatile X audio player that looks like Winamp
cdrecord - command line CD writing tool
mkisofs - Creates ISO-9660 CD-ROM filesystem images
vorbis-tools - provides oggdec, used for decoding the audio files

* Python packages

python2.3-mysqldb - A Python interface for MySQL (depends on libmysqlclient12)
python-pyvorbis - A Python interface to the Ogg Vorbis library
python2.3-xmms - Python interface to XMMS (Python 2.3 version)
python-pyogg - A Python interface to the Ogg library

* Non-debian packages

wxPython > 2.5 - wxWindows Cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit (wxWidgets python bindings)
. refer to INSTALL.wxPython file in this same directory for directions on how to do it


III. Configuration
------------------

--------------
A) SYSTEM SIDE
--------------

NOTE: at this point the server and client should be connected and configured to work
on the same network

0) check the burnstation.conf file, if you installed the burnstation software through
a Debian package, it should be located at /etc/burnstation/burnstation.conf

- set the [database] access information
- set the [path] information to locate the media contents
- set at least the 'burnDevice' parameter inside the [burning] section
- if you are using a joystick, be sure to specify the 'joyType' inside the [extra] section

1) check if shared media directory is being served by server:
	
# smbclient -L //burnstation
# Password:
  (no password, this shared directory should be public)
	
. now you will be logged at the media dir prompt, so try to list its contents:

# ls -l
	
If all the above procedure worked, you can now set the system to automount the media dir on boot.

2) create the mount point for the shared media directory:

	mkdir /usr/local/media

3) edit fs tab with your favorite editor and add the following line at the end of /etc/fstab:
	
	//burnstation/media /usr/local/media smbfs default,password= 0 0

4) mount the shared media dir as set in the /etc/fstab:

	mount -a								

-------------------
B) BURNSTATION SIDE
-------------------

1) check CD-R drive speed and set it in the /etc/burnstation/burnstation.conf file

	burnSpeed = 24
	

* (typical) Burnstation directories:

/usr/local/burnstation - where the program lives, here is all python code, and the Main.py
/usr/local/media - where all the contents live
/var/www/webspace/burnstation.local - where HTML webpages for the infopanel are served
/var/spool/burnstation - temporary/spool directory for holding necessary media to burn
/var/log/burnstation - logs directory *** be sure to have a look there when there are problems

IV. Running the Burn Station client:
------------------------------------

1) you should login into the X using user: burn
2) open a terminal and execute the burnstation command:

	# burnstation.sh
	(note that you should have copied it to a global bin dir as
	explained in section I item 10)

before you execute that command, you will like to do the following in another terminal:

	# tail -f /var/log/burnstation/*

so that you see what's going on while starting the burnstation, to find out problems,
or just by curiosity (the logging level is quite HIGH at the moment, sorry)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  


APPENDIX A :: THINGS TO CHECK IF SOMETHING FAILS 
================================================

. settings in /etc/burnstation/burnstation.conf
. smb running in server and mounted locally (as in installation chapter III step A)
. dhcp running in server providing: 192.168.19.x IP addresses to clients
. xmms running as the same user in client (you can try playing audio by hand in xmms)
. user running the burnstation has permissions to write into the /var/log/burnstation directory
. user running the burnstation belongs to group audio (if you want to hear something) and cdrom (if you want to burn ;)

FAQ

Q: Can I use the burnstation and be connected to the internet at the same time?

A: Yes, however it's a bit tricky. You should have two different networks configured in
your box. One for the burnstation (net 192.168.19.0/24) and any other which lets you
connect to the internet. So the point is to setup a "virtual network interface".
By issuing the following command you will configure your box to be on the same
network as the burnstation server:

	# ifconfig eth0:0 192.168.19.14

Now you should also configure your box to use the burnstation server as DNS
in order to serve you the backend (netjuke) web interface as the "InfoPanels" for
the burnstation client (wxPython) interface.
So add the following line at the beggining of your client's /etc/resolv.conf:

nameserver 192.168.19.1

and after saving it, try the following:

# ping burnstation.local
PING burnstation.local (192.168.19.1): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.19.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.1 ms

if the ping does not work it means your client box is not resolving correctly the names
into IP addresses.

FIXME :: add info on how to do it without nameserver, just IP based
