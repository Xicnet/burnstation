NOTES ON USING 'burnstation'
===============================================================

The following notes explain a couple of things you need to know
when running and using the burnstation software.

1. RUNNING THE CLIENT
2. JOYPAD CONFIGURATION
3. PUBLISHING CONTENTS

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. RUNNING THE CLIENT
=====================

You have two options (modes) for running the client: normal and loop modes.
Just type one of the following commands on a shell:

For 'normal' mode:

 # burnstation

'normal' mode runs the application just as any other application,
which means it will start and after you quit it, it will close normally
and not start again.

For 'loop' mode:

 # burnstation loop

'loop' mode runs the application in an infinite loop, which means every time
you quit it, it will automatically start again immediately. It will do that
forever unless you *kill* the process, normally from a shell (terminal)
with the command:

 # killall burnstation

NOTE: it is important that you *REALLY KILL* the process if it is running
and you want to re-start it at some point. If you run the 'burnstation'
command again when it is already running, you will end up having multiple
instances of the program, which is something you DO NOT want and will lead
to problems while using it.

How to run the 'burnstation' command depends on how you've installed
the software in your system. Both are explained below:

A. Debian packages:

The debian package for the burnstation client will install the 'burnstation'
executable inside /usr/bin which is normally part of your environment's PATH
variable, therefore you can just type the 'burnstation' command in a shell or
create an icon on your desktop.

B. SVN (subversion) or tarball installations on non-Debian systems:

Depending on where you've checked out the burnstation client copy, or
un-tar'ed the .tar.gz file, you will find it within the burnstation-client-2.0/bin
directory. Example:

/home/you/burnstation/burnstation-client-2.0/bin/burnstation

You can just type the complete path to run the software, or even better,
create a symlink from it to your /usr/local/bin (make sure this path is
included within your PATH environment variable).
The following command will do it:

ln -s /home/you/burnstation/burnstation-client-2.0/bin/burnstation /usr/local/bin

Now you can just type: 'burnstation' on a shell and it should start. If you get
something like 'command not found' it's very likely that you don't have
/usr/local/bin on your path.
The following command will add it there:

PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin

Now try again, and it should work.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. JOYPAD CONFIGURATION
=======================

Normally every linux-supported joypad controller will work here.
You can test yours with the 'joystick' tool, which a Debian package,
so:

  sudo apt-get install joystick

will install it for you. Once you got it you can use the following command
to test it:

  jstest /dev/input/js0

Press some buttons and move the sticks from your pad to see if it works.
If you see some movement on your screen, then you are pretty fine!

Now you can learn which values correspond to each button on your joypad
to map them with each action to control the burnstation software:

 A. Run the command:

      burnstation2-joypad_test

    ... and press each button to see their values.

 B. Edit /usr/share/burnstation-server-2.0/JoyConf.py which has the buttons to actions
    mapping.

      You can find an example at the end of that file which reads 'YourModel'.
      Just replace the numbers there with the values you've found using burnstation2-joypad_test.

 C. Finally, edit /etc/burnstation/burnstation2.conf and adapt the 'joyType' under
    the [extra] section to reflect the name of your joypad mapping.

IMPORTANT WARNING: some joypads do not have 'cursors' (position arrows to go
                   up, down, left and right) and sometimes they can mess your
                   burnstation up and it will not run.
                   You can try to set 'cursors = 0' under the [joystick] section
                   of your /etc/burnstation/burnstation2.conf to disable them.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. PUBLISHING CONTENTS
======================

The publishing system to add new contents into the burnstation database
is still experimental.

There are a few requirements for your files in order to publish them.

 They MUST:

 * Be already encoded into OGG/Vorbis having the .ogg extension (not .OGG!).
 * Be already tagged with 'Title' and 'Artist' tags at least.
 * Be already copied to your hard drive (into somewhere like /home/burn/ ).

IMPORTANT: you are encouraged to BACKUP your database completely
           before trying to import any contents, so that you can
           easily revert back in case of trouble, errors or mistakes.

You can do such backup by dumping the whole database with a command like this:

 # mysqldump -u burnstation_user -p burnstation_database > /home/burn/burnstation-db-backup.sql

.. where burnstation_user and burnstation_database should
   match your MySQL user and database for your installation.

Check MySQL documentation in case of doubts at that point.

Once your files are ready to be published follow these steps
to import them into your burnstation database:

 * Start the burnstation software.
 * Press 'r' key to register as a new user or 'l' key to login (if you already have a user)
   NOTE: after you enter your password, press [enter] twice to continue.
 * After you register or login yourself successfully, the music browser will switch from
   showing the burnstation database contents to your filesystem files and directories.
 * Search for the directory where you have the files to be published.
 * Now you have two options:
   1 - Add the whole directory where the files live by stepping on its name and pressing
       the 'add to playlist' key (it is 'v' at the time of this writing).
   2 - Go inside the directory, browse and add each file, one by one, pressing the
       'add to playlist' key. You can still add complete directories including all files
       contained in them too, by pressing the 'add to playlist' key by stepping over the
       desired directory name.
 * Once your 'playlist' (actually your 'publish' list ;) is ready, press the 'p' key
   to publish them.
 * You will be asked for a 'Label' name. If the files you are published do not belong
   to any 'Label' just leave it blank, otherwise fill it in.
 * Press [enter] and wait until you are brought back to the burnstation database.
 * Browse the contents and you should find your recently added contents :)
 * Try to play some of them, add some to your playlist and burn a CD.
 * If all worked fine, you are set! Congratulations and thanks for your interest!
 
NOTE: the publishing process will copy the source files inside a directory named as your user
      under your media directory (normally /usr/local/media). So, for instance, if the user
      you registered is called 'you', then the music will be located at:
      /usr/local/media/you
