Burnstation :: free media distribution system
=============================================

( Read the INSTALL file for setup instructions )

WHAT IS IT?

Burnstation is a complete system client-server model based, to navigate through media
contents, listen to them and select your favorites to burn a CD for takeaway.

HOW WAS IT MADE?

It consists of two parts:

I. SERVER SIDE ::

The server interface for managing contents is absolutely web based, which means
you can control it from any browser running on a box connected to the Burnstation Network.
It connects to the database held on the server itself and provides the content information
to the web-clients accesing the server contents management or backend (netjuke) and also
serves the clients requesting the contents information to display on the "Info Panels"

- works as a DHCP server for the Burnstation clients to autoconfigure
- works also as a local DNS (nameserver) for the Burnstation Network
- holds a shared media directory which the clients should mount locally
- holds the backend interface and the SQL server (for the moment only MySQL is supported!)
- holds the media database with all the information about the contents

II. CLIENT SIDE ::

The client interface was re-coded from wxPython to PyGame.

- runs the Burnstation client interface (python code)
- mounts locally the shared media directory from the server (for distributed setups)
- copies from server to local harddrive (spool dir) and decompresses the music
  when AUDIO burn-mode is selected and converts to Stereo 16-bit 44.1KHz wave files
  to burn as music audio-CD (this consumes CPU!)
- copies from server to local harddrive (spool dir) and creates the ISO image
  for burning as data-mode (consumes CPU and network!)

The Burnstation's Content Management System is based on a hacked version of Netjuke
(whose development stopped some time ago and now merged with Jinzora - http://jinzora.org)
GPL software, which is the most complete and developed web + database
for managing huge media collections I've found by the time of writing this software.
