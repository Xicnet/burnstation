INSTALLING 'burnstation 2.1'
============================

By hand:

* Install dependancies:

sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb python-ogg python-pyvorbis python-mutagen python-id3 python-dbus  python-dbus python-mutagen cdrecord mkisofs vorbis-tools sox eject mpg123 hal pmount cdda2wav python-pygame python-gst0.10 gstreamer0.10-alsa gstreamer0.10-esd gstreamer0.10-gnomevfs gstreamer0.10-plugins-base gstreamer0.10-plugins-base-apps gstreamer0.10-plugins-good gstreamer0.10-x

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

* Add the Debian/Ubuntu packages repository to your /etc/apt/sources.list:

    deb http://burnstation.org/debian/ sarge main

* Update your packages database and install the corresponding packages:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install burnstation-client-2.0 burnstation-server-2.0 burnstation-images-2.0

* Check the config file and give it the right settings.
  Most important are:

  [database] section to connect to your MySQL database.
             The user, password and database will be created
             from those values when you run the burnstation
             for the first time.

             You will be asked for your MySQL super-user name and password.

  [paths] section: choose your musicPath, where the music will be stored.

  [burning] section: choose your burnDevice, which you can find by running
            the following command:

            cdrecord -scanbus

* Create the media directory according to your [paths] musicPath setting
  and give some permissions:

    sudo mkdir /usr/local/media
    sudo chmod 777 /usr/local/media (yes, a bit nasty, tune it at your wish)

* Download the music:

    burnstation2-getnewcontent

  You have to wait until all the music gets downloaded (unless you want to have
  an incomplete/partial collection of music).

  This step will take time, as there are about 12GB of music and growing.

* Validate the downloaded tracks, which will enable them for displaying on
  the burnstation interface, otherwise it will be empty:

    burnstation2-validate_media

* Start the burnstation:

    burnstation2

* Enjoy!
