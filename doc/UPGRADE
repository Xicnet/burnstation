UPGRADING FROM 'burnstation-client' PRIOR TO 2.0 (normally 1.2)
====================================================================================================


      NOTE: this instructions are for SVN users. Debian and Ubuntu packages
            do it all automatically for you!


* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* !!! VERY IMPORTANT NOTE !!!
*
* In order to keep older versions of burnstation-client available,
* version 2.0 of the software appends the suffix -2.0 to the
* SVN and the debian package directory names.
*
* Therefore /usr/share/burnstation-client will be the old version,
* while /usr/share/burnstation-client-2.0 will be the new one.
*
* Same thing for /SVN/burnstation/burnstation-client and
* /SVN/burnstation/burnstation-client-2.0
* ( Assuming your burnstation SVN checkout is located at
*  /SVN/burnstation )
*
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

1. Copy your /etc/burnstation/burnstation.conf
   to /etc/burnstation/burnstation2.conf and adapt it for 2.0:

  NOTE: this step is optional and if you do not do it, the default values
        will be used, which are in fact those listed here below.

  A. Add the following entries directly below the [paths] section:

	# app's home
	home = /usr/share/burnstation-client-2.0
	# app's logs dir
	logs = /var/log/burnstation

  B. Search for 'home' setting within [infotrack] section and rename it to 'data', and add -2.0
     at the end of the directory path. You should end up having something like:

	[infotrack]
	# info track settings
	data = /usr/share/burnstation-client-2.0

  C. Add the following entry at the bottom of [extra] section:

	# player can either be xmms or gst
	player = gst

    You should end up having something like:

	[extra]
	# Default navigation tree type
	treeType = 'music'
	# joystick type to be used. options are: rumblepad, asia, graz
	joyType = rumblepad
	# player can either be xmms or gst
	player = gst

2. Create a symlink from your burnstation-client-2.0 to /usr/share
   For example, if your SVN copy is located at /SVN/burnstation/burnstation-client-2.0
   just do:

   # ln -s /SVN/burnstation/burnstation-client-2.0 /usr/share

3. Symlink the 'burnstation2' executable to /usr/local/bin:

   # ln -s /SVN/burnstation/burnstation-client-2.0/bin/burnstation2 /usr/local/bin

4. Execute the SQL upgrade script from the upgrade directory:

   # cat upgrade/upgrade-to-2.0.sql | mysql -u burn -p burnstation

   NOTE: Replace 'burn' after -u with your MySQL user for burnstation
         and 'burnstation' after -p with your burnstation database name.
